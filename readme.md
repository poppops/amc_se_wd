# We will be creating a business directory website

The website will have the following pages

- **Welcome Page** (Intro, Sign Up/Login form)
- **Account Page** (Logged in users can manage their business listing)
- **Public Listings Page** (Displays all published businesses for users to browse)
- **Detailed Listing Page** (Displays a single business in more detail for users to read)

## To Do:

### 22/01/25

- Implement the site navigation using flexbox.
- Implement the login and registration forms on the landing page.
- Add some content to the website.

Don't just throw the content on the page. Try to make your website look unique.

You can use free tools like Canva to create a simple logo and embed in the headers.

Style your forms and your content so it's presentable and easy to read.
